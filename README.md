Spring boot project using java to build a imitation twittter

## Things that do not work
* Date function from createdAt. It could not find the functionss and considering the time 
I commented it out in the HTML pages. 
* Was also not able to figure out how to make the main fee only follow for follow accounts I'm sure it's something
similar to ${user/follow/} 

## Overall the imitation twitter looks pretty stable and well built

# Tools used
* Spring boot 4
* Maven 
* Eclipse
